Have fun trying to run this/work on it/fix it/debug it/build off of it

This is the Great Games thing, go though each file and look at the comments that look like this
```py
# fill in
```
and do what they say, now run these commands:
```cmd
$ git clone https://github.com/OreoDivision/Great-Games
$ cd Great-Games
$ pip install -r req.txt
```
(you need more then one terminal):
```cmd
$ python main.py
```
```cmd
$ cd api
$ python api.py
```
